## About me 👩‍💻

My name is Marta. I'm a Junior Manual Tester and Test Automation Engineer.

In June 2022 I decided to change my career path from accounting to IT. I finished postgraduate studies in Python programming. The study program covered automated testing with Selenium and Robot Framework. I liked them so much that I decided to become a tester. I even wrote automated tests as the final project. I completed „Automated testing + Python” challenge at Dare IT. I took part in QA marathon organized by GoIT. I’m doing the „Automated Testing Foundations” training at EPAM. I’m interested both in manual and automated testing. Currently I’m taking part in training project organized by Cherry-IT. I’m also preparing for the ISTQB Foundational Level exam.
